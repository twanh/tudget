# TODO

### Backend server
- [x] Create api
- [x] Budget calculation (also transaction budget)
- [ ] Warning system when exceeding budget?
- [ ] Savings updater / add money to saving --> subtract from main accnt
    - May need to implement a new type of transaction for this (perhaps transfer).
- [ ] Finish testing
  
 


### Frontend


### General things to think about :)
 - Should account balance be read only?
    -> Would make it that it can only be updated w/ income/expense
